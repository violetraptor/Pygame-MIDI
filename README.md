pymidi.py
-> Exploring the opportunities of the Pygame MIDI module. This is an exercise for myself. I invite you to learn with me. First step.

pymidi_stepUp.py
-> Second Step: Steps up the musical scale.

Steps

1. Install python on your computer.
2. Make a folder for your new python project such as "pygameMIDI".
3. Download pymidi.py in this folder
4. Open your terminal or PowerShell.
5. Change to your folder with "cd", for example: cd "F:\home\pikatchu\pygameMIDI\"
6. Make a new "Python Virtual Environments": py -m venv venv
7. Activate the venv with: .\venv\Scripts\Activate
8. Install Pygame: pip install pygame
9. Run the file: py .\pymidi.py

Tip: in the venv folder is a example-file: F:\home\pikatchu\venv\Lib\site-packages\pygame\examples --> midi.py
